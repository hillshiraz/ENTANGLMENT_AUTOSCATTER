# ENTANGLMENT_AUTOSCATTER
This code automatically discovers a physical quadratic Hamiltonian (couplings, squeezing, and losses) whose input/output scattering matches a desired target
THE CODE GOAL:
Building an automatic synthesizer (AutoScatter) for Gaussian continuous-variable (CV) photonic systems. Given a target scattering behavior 
S_target at a set of I/O “port” modes, the code searches over a physical Hamiltonian to find concrete device parameters that realize it.
