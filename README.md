# Quantum Comb Synthesizer
This code automates the inverse design of a microcomb based system. Its purpose is to identify the optimal pump frequencies, amplitudes, and phases that synthesize a target quadratic Hamiltonian (described by the g and Î½ matrices). This Hamiltonian governs the system's quantum state and optical behavior. The final goal is to create a specific S
